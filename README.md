# nix-config
## Introduction

This is my personal Nix (Flakes) configuration made for a few of my devices. It is a
continuation of my [previous attempt](https://github.com/itsyunaya/nixos-config-old) of
getting acquainted with Nix, but now actually stable and usable as a daily driver

## Specifications
### Hosts

> [!CAUTION]
> If you wish to use any of these configurations on your own device, you need
> to first replace the respective `hardware-configuration.nix` file with your own.
> Otherwise your system will not boot!

| Host                  | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `juno`                | Main x86 Linux machine                           |
| `ceres`               | Raspberry Pi nixOS setup for pi-hole             |
| `callisto`            | WIP server configuration                         |
| `ashleys-macbook-pro` | Apple silicon Mac configuration using nix-darwin |

### juno

This configuration features a dual compositor setup with MangoWM and Hyprland, 
wherein it is possible to switch between the two just by setting one config option
in `configuration.nix`, under the `juno-cfg` attrset. Further options like
the active lockscreen app or terminal can also be set.

Other than that, this is a fairly regular config including Waybar, Anyrun, Dunst, etc.
but also a plethora of packages I personally use.

### ceres

Minimal NixOS config just for deploying [Pi-Hole](https://pi-hole.net/) on a Raspberry Pi 4B.
Make sure you have enough storage on your device before building for the first time (>32GB)
since otherwise the build may fail. Also note that it will take a very long time to complete.

### callisto

Very work in progress server configuration (not commited to repository yet) including
but not limited to:
- Nix-Minecraft for multiple Minecraft servers
- Nextcloud & Samba Servers for data management
- Various Webservers
- Discord Bot Hosting

### ashleys-macbook-pro

Minimal nix-darwin configuration with home-manager. Only has some basic packages and a simple
shell setup for now.

## Other

The `packages` directory includes sofware I've packaged myself.

## Note

This config is still work in progress and may change drastically at any time.
